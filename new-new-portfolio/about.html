            <h1>My Journey with Web Development</h1>
            <p>My journey into technology began with a simple curiosity: how do websites actually work? That curiosity quickly turned into a passion when I realized that software could do more than just entertain. It could solve real-world problems.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am a student at Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University, where I focus on backend architecture. What drives me is the satisfaction of taking a buggy, inefficient system and making it run seamlessly.</p>

            <h2>What I Love About C#</h2>
            <p>I chose C# and the .NET ecosystem because of its strong typing and robust framework. Building applications with ASP.NET Core allows me to create secure, scalable web apps efficiently. I particularly enjoy working with Entity Framework to manage databases without writing raw SQL.</p>
